{"text": "<|im_start|>user\nThree friends decide to split the cost of a $60 meal evenly. However, they later realize that they received a 20% discount on their bill. What should each friend pay if they want to split the discounted bill evenly?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI need to find out how much each friend should pay after applying the 20% discount.\n\nLet me work through this step by step:\n\nFirst, let me find the discounted bill amount:\n- Original bill: $60\n- Discount: 20% of $60 = 0.20 × $60 = $12\n- Discounted bill: $60 - $12 = $48\n\nNow I'll split the discounted bill evenly among the three friends:\n- Each friend pays: $48 ÷ 3 = $16\n\nLet me verify this makes sense:\n- 3 friends × $16 each = $48 total\n- $48 is indeed the discounted amount ($60 - $12 discount)\n\nTherefore, each friend should pay $16."}
